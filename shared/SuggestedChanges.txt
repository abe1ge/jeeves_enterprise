General suggestions:
	1: Create an empty "files" folder in each module, several of them need to move files there.
	2: Consider using only one puppet modules location, so far some go to /etc/puppet/modules, others go to /usr/share/puppet/modules. 
	   suggest /opt/.
	
Module test results - What I had to do manually

All:

	1: Copy modules to correct location from /shared/ (Can be done in bootstrap)
	2: Run puppet apply (To be sorted once everything works)
	3: Ensure they can be run from master, then sync agents.

Java:
	Runs fine, but very location dependent. Ensure this gets copied to the correct folder.
	
Maven:
	Runs fine, regardless of location
	
Git:
	Runs fine, consider installing somewhere other than /tmp?
	
Jenkins:
	Runs fine, just be patient
	
Jira:
	Absolutely perfect, the best module out of all of them. Consider rewarding the creator for his hard work.
	Change port to 8082, other thing 8007
	
Bamboo:
	Runs fine (No errors)
